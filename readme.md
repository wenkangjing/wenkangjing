Software Engineer & Tech Lead

I put my thoughts on [Medium](https://jamiewen00.medium.com/) and [Tech Lead Handbook](https://jamiewen00.gitbook.io/tech-lead-handbook/)
> To become a senior technical leader, you must build a deep perspective on technology and architecture. To operate as such a leader, you must then develop an equally deep **pragmatism** and **agnosticism** to technical religion to remain skeptical of yourself. This can feel like a paradox, but it’s the line you’ll need to walk every day.
